# GitHub MCP

Access GitHub repositories, pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

The GitHub MCP Server enables AI agents to interact with GitHub programmatically. It provides tools for repository
operations, code review, issue management, and CI/CD pipeline inspection.

## Configuration

The MCP server is configured in `.rulesync/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "oauth": false,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {env:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

> **Prerequisites:** Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with a GitHub Personal Access Token.
