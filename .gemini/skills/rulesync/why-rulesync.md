# Why Rulesync?

## Single Source of Truth

Author rules once, generate everywhere. Rulesync turns a unified ruleset into tool-native formats so teams stop duplicating instructions across multiple AI assistants.

## Tool Freedom Without Friction

Let developers pick the assistant that fits their flow—Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code, and more—without rewriting team standards.

## Clean, Auditable Outputs

Rulesync emits plain configuration files you can commit, review, and ship. If you ever uninstall Rulesync, your generated files keep working.

## Fast Onboarding & Consistency

New team members get the same conventions, context, and guardrails immediately, keeping code style and quality consistent across tools.

## Multi-Tool & Modular Workflows

Compose rules, MCP configs, commands, and subagents for different tools or scopes (project vs. global) without fragmenting your workflow.

## Ready for What's Next

AI tool ecosystems evolve quickly. Rulesync helps you add, switch, or retire tools while keeping your rules intact.
