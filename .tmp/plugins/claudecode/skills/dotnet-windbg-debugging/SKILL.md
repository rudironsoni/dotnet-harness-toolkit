# dotnet-windbg-debugging

Windows user-mode debugging using WinDbg MCP tools. Applicable to any Windows application -- native, managed (.NET/CLR), or mixed-mode. Guides investigation of crash dumps, application hangs, high CPU, and memory pressure through structured command packs and report templates.

**Platform:** Windows only.

## Scope

- Crash dump analysis (.dmp files) for any Windows process (native, .NET, or mixed-mode)
- Live process attach via cdb debug server
- Hang and deadlock diagnosis (thread analysis, lock detection)
- High CPU triage (runaway thread identification)
- Memory pressure and leak investigation via native heap analysis
- Kernel dump triage (BSOD / bugcheck analysis)
- COM/RPC wait chain and UI message pump analysis
- Structured diagnostic reports with stack evidence

## Out of scope

- .NET SDK diagnostic tools (dotnet-counters, dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump) -- see [skill:dotnet-profiling]
- GC tuning and managed memory optimization -- see [skill:dotnet-gc-memory]
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection -- see [skill:dotnet-benchmarkdotnet]
- Application performance architecture patterns -- see [skill:dotnet-performance-patterns]

## MCP Tool Contract

Use these `mcp-windbg` operations:

1. `mcp_mcp-windbg_open_windbg_remote` -- attach to a live debug server
2. `mcp_mcp-windbg_open_windbg_dump` -- open a saved dump file
3. `mcp_mcp-windbg_run_windbg_cmd` -- execute debugger commands
4. `mcp_mcp-windbg_close_windbg_remote` -- detach from live session
5. `mcp_mcp-windbg_close_windbg_dump` -- close dump session

## Quick Start

1. Configure and access MCP: see `reference/access-mcp.md`
2. Choose workflow:
   - Live attach: see `reference/live-attach.md`
   - Dump analysis: see `reference/dump-workflow.md`
3. Choose a task reference: see `reference/scenario-command-packs.md`
4. Use support references as needed:
   - Sanity check: `reference/sanity-check.md`
   - Symbols: `reference/symbols.md`
   - Common patterns: `reference/common-patterns.md`
   - Capture playbooks: `reference/capture-playbooks.md`
5. Return results using `reference/report-template.md`
6. Close the debug session.

## Completion Criteria

- Correct mode selected (live or dump)
- Task reference executed for the symptom
- Findings reference concrete stacks/threads/modules
- Session closed cleanly

## Guardrails

- Do not claim certainty without callee-side evidence
- Do not call it a deadlock unless lock/wait evidence supports it
- Preserve user privacy: do not include secrets from environment blocks in reports
